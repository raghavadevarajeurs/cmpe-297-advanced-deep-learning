Short Story: Video-Language Pre-training based on Transformer Models
-
In this article, we begin with understanding the basic transformer architecture. Then continue to learn about various approaches for pre-training and fine-tuning methods used by transformer-based models for video training. We will also see various datasets available for video training. Then we have an overview of all the notable transformer models used for video training.
