Automatically Build Variant Interpretable ML models
-

Auto_ViML was designed for building High Performance Interpretable Models with the fewest variables. The "V" in Auto_ViML stands for Variable because it tries multiple models with multiple features to find you the best performing model for your dataset. The "i" in Auto_ViML stands for "interpretable" since Auto_ViML selects the least number of features necessary to build a simpler, more interpretable model. In most cases, Auto_ViML builds models with 20-99% fewer features than a similar performing model with all included features (this is based on my trials. Your experience may vary).

Following are the differnt AutoVIML tasks that I have performed for this assignment
1. Tabular data classification using Titanic dataset
2. Image classification using Mashroom dataset
3. NLP based twitter sentiment analysis for hatred speech
